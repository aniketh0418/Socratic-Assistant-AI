            <h2>Socratic Assistant AI</h2>
            <p>Our Socratic Assistant AI leverages the Socratic Method of learning, which encourages self-discovery through questioning. It is more efficient than traditional methods because it fosters critical thinking, deeper understanding, and active participation. Unlike conventional teaching, which often relies on passive listening, our AI promotes a dialogue-based approach to learning, encouraging users to think for themselves and explore topics at their own pace.</p>

            <h2>How does it work and how to use it?</h2>
            <p>Our Socratic Assistant AI is powered by Generative AI technology. It uses advanced machine learning models to interpret your inputs and provide relevant responses in the form of questions. This dynamic interaction encourages the user to actively think and engage with the content, which leads to a deeper understanding. This ensures that anyone can be taught in the way of self-discovery with high efficiency. To get started, simply ask the AI to teach you about any subject. You can input text directly, or provide a dynamic link (e.g., YouTube), document, video, image, or audio file. The AI will guide you through the content using the Socratic Method, asking thought-provoking questions and helping you understand complex concepts.<span id="special"> Hit the "Start Session" button in the top corner of the screen to start interacting with Socratic Assistant AI.</span> </p>

        <h2>Potential Use Cases of This AI</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Students: The AI's guided questioning approach can help students think critically and develop a deeper, yet effective understanding.</li>
            <li>Therapists and Counselors: Using Socratic questioning in therapy, especially in cognitive-behavioral approaches, can help clients explore thoughts and challenges in a more structured way.</li>
            <li>Educators: Teachers and professionals could use this AI as a supplementary tool to encourage student engagement and active learning.</li>
            <li>Self-Learners: For those exploring subjects independently, the AI provides a structured learning path, guiding them through complex topics by asking thought-provoking questions that encourage deep conversation.</li>
            <li>Corporate Trainers: The AI could enhance employee training programs by promoting critical thinking and retention through structured questioning, making it especially useful in technical and skill-based training environments.</li>
            <li id="special">Problem Solving (Programming): This AI has the potential to provide effective insights into programming concepts, making the problem-solving process more interactive, easy to understand, and simpler to debug.</li>
